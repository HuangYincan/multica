// the BRIEF has to add are the ones the agent cannot infer from a working
// directory: which line it is on, and that delivery goes back to the same one.
//
// The second matters most. Nothing in the platform creates pull requests —
// `gh pr create` is the agent's own call, and without --base it targets the
// repository's default branch. A PR opened that way asks to merge into the
// wrong place AND carries every commit the pinned branch has that the default
// lacks.
